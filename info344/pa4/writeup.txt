Nadav Ashkenazi - INFO 344 PA4 Writeup

Implementing an end to end experience in this assigment was a simple matter of
exposing a JSONP api from assignment 1, and then combining files from pa2 and 3
into one azure service with a web role and worker role. There are some new
features in this assignment, like querying the database by words, which I
implemented in a separate service. Otherwise, it was all a simple matter of
glueing the pieces together which, for the most part, was pretty quick and
straightforward.

Most of the code stayed the same from the previous assignments. Besides some
small tweaks to the crawler and some now additions to the query suggestions
service, there wasn't much new code in the old assignments. The core of the
work was in working on the search service, which I implemented with another
asmx file and used LINQ queries to fetch and process data from the azure table.
I also made some utility objects for helping me with sending JSON over to the
javascript frontend.

Everything works when deployed to azure. The ec2 instance from assignment 1 is
still live and running with the new JSONP api and seems to be stable. I added
another WebJob to make sure that the trie for query suggestions stays in
memory for as long as possible and that seems to be working as well. There were
a few issues while converting my query suggestions website into a web role, but
I managed to solve those using the specific facilities provided by the azure
service.
