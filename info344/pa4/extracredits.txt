I implemented one extra credit in this assignment:

1. Beautiful search results page

I decided to take some time and tranfer over some of the nice stilying from pa1
for the player display into the search results page. Player cards are big and
beautiful. I used bootstrap as well to layout and organize my search page,
which is pretty simple for the most part. Nothing to flashy besides some
borders, shadows, and loading markers when a search query is taking a long time
to process.

Also, I made sure to include the nice query suggestions box from pa2 because it
works well with the experience and looks good.
