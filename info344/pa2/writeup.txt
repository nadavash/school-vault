The web service was implemented using an ASMX service that contained
the GetSuggestions and GetSuggestionsRanked service methods. During
initialization, the service checks if it has the necessary text files in the
filesystem and if it does not it goes ahead and fetches the files from blob
storage. After that is done, the trie data structure is populated with strings
from the wiki.txt file. The trie helps keep the total runtime of the
service calls very short.

I use jQuery to make an ajax call to the suggestions service and populate ul
with list items from the results. The results include the string and the
ranking of the suggestions to display as a badge on the right side of the li.

I have a separate file for the Trie data structure, which also uses a custom
map object called AlphabetMap.

I am not using an azure WebRole for this project, but instead using a simple
website because I managed to get the entire Trie data structure to fit in
memory. To keep the web service alive, I wrote a python script that runs as
a web job and pings the suggestions service with a simple web call. The job
runs every 10 minutes.
