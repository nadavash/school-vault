I implemented one extra credit for this assignment:

For this assignment I decided to implement the threading extra credit tha allows
my crawler to crawl mulitple urls concurrently. I used a thread pool to implement
this extra credit.

My crawler has a crawlNext method that dispatches a task to the thread pool to
start processing a particular url. This way, I call CrawlNext and immediately
return. I can call crawlNext multiple times to queue more and more workers. The
thread pool then processes those jobs as new threads open up.
