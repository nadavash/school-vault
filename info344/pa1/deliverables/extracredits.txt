I implemented three extra credits for this assignment:
1. [10pts] Misspelled names work gracefully

I used the PHP standard function 'levenshtein' which allowed me to find the
edit distance between two strings. I used this along with some other logic
to try to display the best results. Now, mispelled names work, as long as they
are close to the intended name.

3. [6pts] Results page looks really really nice (CSS) **

I used bootstrap along with some custom CSS to make some of the UI controls and
containers look better.

4. [2pts] Embedded photos of player

This was fairly hard to figure out. I decided to piggyback off of the nba.com
CDN for profile pictures of the players, which are predictable using the player
first and last name. If the picture does not exist, I use a stock photo to
keep the page and player info cards consistent.
