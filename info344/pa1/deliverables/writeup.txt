I implemented the website as one page that handles both user input and processing
the query to search in the database. When you first go to the website, the page
is initially empty. Entering a name into the textbox and clicking the search button
redirects to the same index page with a query parameter, which causes the page
to look for the player in the database. All of the matching players and their stats
are then displayed below the search box.

For the data, I decided to use Sequel Pro for Mac instead of phpMyAdmin because I
prefer the software better. I connected to the RDS instance from Sequel Pro and
created a database called "nba", and created a table called "Players" with all of
the necessary columns. I cleaned up the data from the CSV using excel, and imported
the data into the database on RDS using Sequel Pro. I also made sure to set up a
user on RDS for the ec2 server to use when connecting.

The PHP code is divided into three files:
	index.php - the view of the website, handles user input and displaying results
	Player.php - represents a single player objects that holds the player name and
		other statistics about the player.
	PlayerDao.php - this is the object that directly interfaces with the database,
		and returns results as a Player object to the client. All the SQL code is
		within PlayerDao.php.
	default.ini - an options file with variables like 'user' and 'pass' to help
		connect to a database instance easily.

Setting up the server was arguably the hardest. I started with a SUSE 12 instance
on ec2 which turned out not to have all of the necessary packages for the assignment,
so I switched to SUSE 11 which seemed to work fine. I installed apache2, php, and
all of the other necessary packages. I set up a virtual host for apache2 that points
to the website files in my home directory, and ran the server. Everything beyond this
point worked fairly well.
