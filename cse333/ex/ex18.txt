Exercise 18

1. The Eraser signals a data race when the set of possible locks for any
variable v is the empty set. This condition is chosen because when all
candidate locks are eliminated for any v, that means v is not consistently
protected by any lock, which is a pretty good sign that there may be a data
race.

2. Eraser may signal a false positive in cases where programs used their own
memory managment and locking facilities. Eraser can also raise false alarms for
variables that are protected by multiple protecting locks (essentially single 
write, multi read functionality). For false negatives, Eraser may miss 
reporting on races if there was no attempted access to v by one thread while 
another is initializing it.
