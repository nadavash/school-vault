Exercise 4a

1. To append something to Alice's notes file, we must:
   a. Open the file using the 'open' system call and get a file descriptor
      to /homes/alice/notes.txt
   b. Use the system call 'lseek' to immediately jump to the end of the file
   c. Use the 'write' system call to begin writing at that position to the file
   d. Call the 'close' function after writing to the end of the file
2. To insert some lines at the beginning of the notes file:
   a. We use the 'open' call like in (1)
   b. Open a second, temporary file with the 'open' call
   c. Begin writing to the temporary file the desired lines using 'write'
   d. Using the 'read' on the original notes.txt, write all of it's contents to
      the temporary file using the 'write' call
   e. Once the copying is done, 'close' the notes.txt file and delete the original 
      notes.txt file with the 'remove' system call
   f. Close the temporary file and rename it to 'notes.txt'
