Exercise 19

1. I found the "Null Pointer Dereferencre" bug in the second paper to be the
interesting bug because it is an optimization that makes sense but also breaks
major programs like the linux kernel. Finally, it seems like a bug that I could
definitely encounter myself because it deals with something rather common, like
dereferencing a null pointer which may happen every once in a while if I'm not
careful.

2. Ironically, the most time consuming bug I encountered was a simple null
dereference issue which threw a segfault for me in assigment 3. I had copied
some code with a null check and changed the variable names, but forgot to
change it for the null check as well. Since we were dealing with loading data
from files in assigment 3, I thought I got garbage data from the file possibly
and I started looking and the index reader objects to see if the issue came
from there. I eventually noticed that my null check was checking the wrong
variable name.
