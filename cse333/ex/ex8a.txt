Exercise 8a

1. The main function in the appendix is executed in the User Program area
during the initial parts of the MapReduce process. The Map method of the
WordCounter gets called in the workers on the left side of the figure,
during the map phase. The Added Reduce method gets executed in the right
hand side of the figure, during the reduce phase. WordCounter's Map method
would then be provided with a string text that comes from the split files all
the way on the left of the figure, and then it emits the results, which is a
string representation of the word an a "1", to intermediate storage. Those
are then sent over in an iterator to the Reducer, which finally sends its
results to output files.

2. The Master of the MapReduce figure will be in charge in handling failures
of any of the MapReduce workers. Thus, if an error occures in
WordCounter::Map() which causes the worker to crash, the worker sends a 
"last gasp" message to the master and the master can then handle the issue. It
can do this either by skipping the data, rerunning the worker, etc.
