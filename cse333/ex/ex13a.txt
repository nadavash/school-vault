Exercise 13a

Valgrind only complains on the first run for input of 100. My guess is that
since we are only off by 1 byte from the buffer in the first case, we will
try to read memory that is outside of the buffer that is used for malloc's
tail. This would be memory that valgrind will proclaim as invalid for reading.
However, when we use an input of 500 we will actually start looking at memory
from the 1000b buffer, which will be considered as a valid region by valgrind.
